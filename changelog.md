0. Installed font awsome for icon support.

3. Add a hamberger icon to accompoany the 'MEMU' buttom for mobile viewing.

3rd party script:
The instagram third party script and element is added to the comment board page. It is set as fixed position on the left side of the screen, to not flow with the web scale. It is added as a redirection to my instagram profile and increase its exposure and interaction, and to provide another form of comments and intereation -- by leaving a like and comments to my post.
